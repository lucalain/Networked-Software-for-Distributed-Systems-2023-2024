# Networked Software for Distributed Systems

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **"Networked Software for Distributed Systems"** course at **Politecnico di Milano**, taught by **Prof. Luca Mottola** and **Prof. Alessandro Margara** during the academic year **2023â€“2024**. 

ðŸŽ“ **Final Grade: 30/30**

The objective was to gain hands-on experience with modern middleware technologies and frameworks used in building scalable, distributed systems and network applications.The project covers a wide range of technologies, each selected to highlight different aspects of distributed computing, from messaging systems to stream processing and IoT.

### Technologies Used

-   **[Akka](./akka)**  
    A toolkit for building highly concurrent, distributed, and fault-tolerant applications using the actor model and asynchronous message passing.
    
-   **[Kafka](./kafka)**  
    A distributed event streaming platform designed for high-throughput, low-latency real-time data pipelines and stream processing.
    
-   **[Spark](./spark)**  
    A powerful engine for large-scale data analytics with support for batch processing, streaming, machine learning, and graph computation.
    
-   **[Node-RED](./node_red)**  
    A flow-based development tool for visual programming, commonly used to integrate APIs, hardware, and online services.
    
-   **[MPI](./mpi)**  
    The Message Passing Interface, a standard for parallel programming in distributed-memory systems.
    
-   **[IoT (Contiki)](./iot)**  
    An open-source operating system for the Internet of Things, optimized for resource-constrained devices and wireless communication.
    
### Topics Covered

-   Distributed communication models (message passing, pub/sub)
    
-   Actor-based concurrency with **Akka**
    
-   Event streaming and data pipelines with **Kafka**
    
-   Scalable data analytics using **Apache Spark**
    
-   Visual flow-based programming with **Node-RED**
    
-   Parallel computing with **MPI**
    
-   IoT systems and embedded networking using **Contiki OS**
    
-   Evaluation of scalability, fault-tolerance, and responsiveness across platforms


## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into subfolders, each dedicated to a specific technology. Inside each folder, you will find:

-   **Evaluation Labs**: These labs were graded and contributed to the final course score.
    
-   **Exercise Labs**: Labs where exercises were assigned to explore and implement key concepts hands-on.
